 While working with arrays, the lib allows to create an array with a fixed size

 ## Weighted
This method allows to attribute weight to each element to be generated. For this example, this would generate twice as many apples as bananas.
 
 The size was setted randomly to show the example ðŸª„

 ## Loop
The loop method would create an array of a random size containing a loop of the previously selected values.
 For this example, the size was setted in order to show the expected result ðŸª„

 Map returns an object with the results of mapping the given closure over the previous elements
 */

Map returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over sequence. In this case, the array of characters would be transformed into a String

    .map { (chars: [Character]) -> String in String(chars) }

## FlatMap
 Flat map would flatten up the result of the map, and it would turn the received value into a Generator. For this example. There is an array of integer generators that would be flatten up on a single integer generator
 */

 Let's choose a random generator by turning it into a generator.

 Then we generate a random generator.
 From that generator, we can generate a random value
 */

generatorOfRandomGenerators.next(.random()).next(.predetermined())

/*:
 The approach shown above has two problems:
 1. The syntax is not very ergonomic - there are 2 .next calls
 2. The need to send the same random source to both if we want to maintain predictability.
 
 We can solve both aforementioned problems using flatMap.
 */

/*:
## Zip.
Zip operators combine two generators and emit a single element for each combination.
When you zip two Generators, it returns a single Generator with an array of the two elements zipped. Here is a demonstration that the zip return is correct.
