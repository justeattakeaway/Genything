/// Length
/// ==============
/// This Sequence is infinite! Do not attempt to for-in the contents without limiting the sequence. To limit the sequence you can make use of Sequence operators such as `prefix()`.

/// Repeated Access
/// ==============
/// This sequence is destructively consumed by iteration. As a consequence, donâ€™t assume that multiple for-in loops will either resume iteration or restart from the beginning:
